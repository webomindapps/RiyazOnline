            <h5>Being a Part of RiyaazOnline</h5>
            <p> RiyaazOnline is a musical school. And just like any other school - when you enroll, you reserve a
                dedicated weekly time slot that's exclusively yours. This ensures you always have your lesson time
                waiting for you, while helping me manage my limited time effectively.</p>
            <h5>Monthly Fees & Extended Absences</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: 500;">Can I pause payments when I'm away for a month or two (traveling, family
                commitments, jobchanges, exams,
                etc.)?</p>
            <p>Just like a school where you can't pause and resume fees according to your schedule, classes cannot be
                paused here either. Monthly fees continue whether you attend or don't attend classes, as your slot
                remains reserved for you</p>
            <p>This applies to both one-on-one and group classes</p>
            <h5>Compensation Classes</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: 500;">If I miss a month or two with prior notice, can the classes be compensated?</p>
            <p>Compensating a complete month or two of classes isn't practically possible. However, with mutual
                understanding and depending on the grounds of your absence - particularly in cases of medical emergency
                - only a few classes may be considered for compensation</p>
            <p>This flexibility applies only to one-on-one classes, not group classes.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 500;">If I miss a class or two in a week and give prior notice, will my classes be
                adjusted?</p>
            <p> While it's advisable not to ask for compensation classes frequently, we can consider a compensation
                class once every two months with prior notice and mutual understanding.</p>
            <p> This applies only to one-on-one classes, not group classes.</p>
            <h5> Why These Policies Exist</h5>
            <p>This system ensures fairness for everyone. Your reserved slot means I can't temporarily reassign it to
                others, and my limited time means I can't create unlimited makeup sessions. The membership model allows
                me to provide consistent, quality instruction while managing realistic scheduling constraints.</p>
            <h5>Questions?</h5>
            <p> If you have specific circumstances you'd like to discuss, I'm always happy to chat and see what might be
                possible within our framework. Thanks for understanding.
            </p>
            <p>I look forward to making great music together!</p>
            <p>These policies help us provide consistent, quality instruction for all our students</p>
